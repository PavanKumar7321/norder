The provided code describes mock data for invoices in a JavaScript application. Based on this structure and data, we can design corresponding entities and relationships for a Spring Boot application.

Here's the Spring Boot design:

### 1. Entities:

#### InvoiceStatus Enum:
```java
public enum InvoiceStatus {
    PAID,
    PENDING,
    OVERDUE,
    DRAFT
}
```

#### Invoice Entity:
```java
@Entity
public class Invoice {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
    private Long id;

    private String invoiceNumber;
    private double taxes;
    private double discount;
    private double shipping;
    private double subTotal;
    private double totalAmount;
    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    private InvoiceStatus status;
    private LocalDateTime createDate;
    private LocalDateTime dueDate;
    private int sent;

    @OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    private List<Item> items;

    @OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    private Address invoiceFrom;

    @OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    private Address invoiceTo;

    // Getters, Setters, Constructors...
}
```

#### Item Entity:
```java
@Entity
public class Item {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
    private Long id;

    private String title;
    private String description;
    private double price;
    private String service;
    private int quantity;
    private double total;

    // Getters, Setters, Constructors...
}
```

#### Address Entity (for invoiceFrom and invoiceTo):
```java
@Entity
public class Address {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
    private Long id;

    // Assuming the structure from `_addressBooks` 
    // e.g., name, street, city, state, postalCode, country, etc.

    // Getters, Setters, Constructors...
}
```

### 2. Repository:
```java
public interface InvoiceRepository extends JpaRepository<Invoice, Long> {
    // Custom query methods (if required)...
}
```

### 3. Service:
```java
@Service
public class InvoiceService {

    @Autowired
    private InvoiceRepository invoiceRepository;

    // Methods to add, update, delete, and fetch invoices...
}
```

### 4. Controller:
```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/invoices")
public class InvoiceController {

    @Autowired
    private InvoiceService invoiceService;

    // Endpoints for adding, updating, deleting, and fetching invoices...
}
```

### Notes:

- **Validation**: Add validation annotations (`@NotNull`, `@Size`, etc.) to entity fields to ensure data integrity.
  
- **Relationships**: Depending on the actual use-case, you may need to refine entity relationships (e.g., many-to-many, one-to-many).

- **Date Handling**: Ensure you're using the correct date libraries (like Java 8's `LocalDateTime`) and handling time zones appropriately.

- **Database Optimization**: Depending on the size of the dataset, you might want to use database optimizations like indexing.

This design provides a foundational structure for representing and managing invoices in a Spring Boot application. Depending on your application's specifics, you may need further refinements or extensions.
