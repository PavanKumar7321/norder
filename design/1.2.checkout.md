Based on the provided information, you want to represent different delivery options. Each option has a name (e.g., "Free", "Standard", "Express"), a cost (e.g., $0, $10, $20), and a delivery duration (e.g., "5-7 Days delivery").

Here's a design outline for representing these delivery options:

### 1. DeliveryOption Entity:

```java
@Entity
public class DeliveryOption {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
    private Long id;

    private String name;          // e.g., "Free", "Standard", "Express"
    private double cost;          // e.g., 0, 10, 20
    private String deliveryTime;  // e.g., "5-7 Days delivery", "3-5 Days delivery"

    // Getters, Setters, Constructors...
}
```

### Repository:

To manage the CRUD operations for the `DeliveryOption` entity:

```java
public interface DeliveryOptionRepository extends JpaRepository<DeliveryOption, Long> {
    // Custom query methods (if required)...
}
```

### Service:

A service layer to encapsulate business logic related to delivery options:

```java
@Service
public class DeliveryOptionService {

    @Autowired
    private DeliveryOptionRepository deliveryOptionRepository;

    // Methods to add, update, delete, and fetch delivery options...
}
```

### Controller:

A controller layer to expose REST API endpoints for managing delivery options:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/delivery-options")
public class DeliveryOptionController {

    @Autowired
    private DeliveryOptionService deliveryOptionService;

    // Endpoints for adding, updating, deleting, and fetching delivery options...
}
```

With this design, you can add new delivery options, update existing ones, fetch available options, and delete options as needed. The design provides flexibility and can be easily extended in the future.

For representing a credit/debit card in a system, it's crucial to follow best practices for security and compliance, especially when it comes to storing sensitive information. Let's design a system keeping in mind these considerations:

1. **Never store full card numbers or CVV/CVC**. Most standards, such as PCI DSS, prohibit the storage of the CVV/CVC number. Also, if you're not PCI compliant, you shouldn't be storing full card numbers either. Instead, utilize a payment gateway that provides tokenization services, and store the token in your database.

2. **Encryption**: Any sensitive data that must be stored should be encrypted using robust encryption algorithms.

Given these considerations, here's a design:

### 1. Card Entity:

```java
@Entity
public class Card {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
    private Long id;

    private String cardToken;         // Token representing the card, provided by payment gateway
    private String maskedCardNumber;  // e.g., "XXXX XXXX XXXX 1234"
    private String cardHolderName;    // e.g., "JOHN DOE"
    private String expirationDate;    // e.g., "MM/YY"
    
    // No field for CVV/CVC as it shouldn't be stored

    // Getters, Setters, Constructors...
}
```

### 2. Repository:

```java
public interface CardRepository extends JpaRepository<Card, Long> {
    // Custom query methods (if required)...
}
```

### 3. Service:

```java
@Service
public class CardService {

    @Autowired
    private CardRepository cardRepository;

    // Methods to add, update, delete, and fetch card information...
    // For adding or updating, integrate with the payment gateway's API for tokenization.
}
```

### 4. Controller:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/cards")
public class CardController {

    @Autowired
    private CardService cardService;

    // Endpoints for adding, updating, deleting, and fetching card information...
}
```

### 5. Security:

- **SSL**: Ensure your service is secured with SSL to encrypt the data during transmission.
  
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Ensure only authenticated users can add, update, or delete their card details. Consider using JWT or OAuth for authentication.

- **Integration with Payment Gateway**: When a card is added or updated, use the payment gateway's API to tokenize the card details. Store only the token and other non-sensitive information in your database.

Remember, handling card information requires strict adherence to security practices. Always stay updated with the latest security standards and practices. If you're unsure, it might be best to consult with a security expert or use services that abstract away these complexities.

From the provided data, it appears you want a design to represent user addresses. Each address has:

1. A name (e.g., "Jayvion Simon")
2. A type or label (e.g., "Home", "Office")
3. A status (e.g., "Default")
4. An address (street, city, state, and postal code)
5. A phone number

Given this structure, let's design the entities, repository, service, and controller layers.

### 1. Address Entity:

```java
@Entity
public class Address {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
    private Long id;

    private String name;          // e.g., "Jayvion Simon"
    private String type;          // e.g., "Home", "Office"
    private boolean isDefault;    // true if this address is the default address
    private String streetAndSuite; // e.g., "19034 Verna Unions Apt. 164"
    private String cityAndState;  // e.g., "Honolulu, RI"
    private String postalCode;    // e.g., "87535"
    private String phoneNumber;   // e.g., "365-374-4961"

    // Getters, Setters, Constructors...
}
```

### 2. Repository:

```java
public interface AddressRepository extends JpaRepository<Address, Long> {
    // Custom query methods (if required)...
}
```

### 3. Service:

```java
@Service
public class AddressService {

    @Autowired
    private AddressRepository addressRepository;

    // Methods to add, update, delete, and fetch addresses...
}
```

### 4. Controller:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/addresses")
public class AddressController {

    @Autowired
    private AddressService addressService;

    // Endpoints for adding, updating, deleting, and fetching addresses...
}
```

### Notes:

- **Validation**: You should add validation for the fields. For example, phone numbers should follow a specific format, and postal codes should be validated depending on the country.
  
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Ensure only authenticated users can add, update, or delete their address details. Users should also be restricted from accessing or modifying other users' addresses.

This design provides a basic structure to represent and manage user addresses. Depending on your application requirements, you might need further refinements or additional features.
